# Higher Health Platform

**Higher Health Platform** is a Django-based web application designed to address gender-based violence (GBV) and cyberbullying in higher learning institutions in South Africa. The platform enables students to report incidents anonymously, connect with healthcare workers and counselors, schedule appointments, access vital information, and explore educational resources—all from their mobile devices or desktop.

## Overview

The Higher Health Platform was created in response to the growing need for accessible, confidential support for students experiencing GBV and cyberbullying. By automating and streamlining the process of reporting incidents and connecting students with trusted healthcare providers, our platform aims to empower students and support Higher Health’s mission to foster safe educational environments.

## Features

- **Anonymous Incident Reporting:**  
  Students can report incidents of GBV and cyberbullying without revealing their identity.

- **Real-Time Assistance Requests:**  
  A dedicated "Request Help" function provides immediate support by notifying healthcare workers.

- **Counseling Chat:**  
  Secure, real-time chat functionality allows students to communicate directly with counselors and healthcare workers.

- **Appointment Scheduling:**  
  Students can schedule confidential counseling appointments with available healthcare professionals.

- **Informational Resources:**  
  Access articles, educational content, and details on health programs to better understand and address these issues.

- **Mobile-Friendly Design:**  
  Designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring a smooth experience on both mobile devices and desktops.

## Architecture

The platform is built using Django as the backend framework. Key components include:

- **Models:**  
  - `IncidentReport` for capturing anonymous incident reports.  
  - `ChatSession` and `ChatMessage` for managing real-time chat between students and counselors.  
  - `Appointment` for scheduling counseling sessions.  
  - `Article` and `HealthProgram` for informational content.

- **Views:**  
  Endpoints for reporting incidents, requesting help, starting chat sessions, scheduling appointments, and viewing content.

- **Templates:**  
  HTML templates using Bootstrap for responsive design and a professional UI.

- **URLs:**  
  Organized URL routing for various endpoints to ensure clean and maintainable code.
